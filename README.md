# Trading Wheels
A personal project for a web application that allows the user to manage their own stock portfolio. My goal is to develop a platform for beginning investors. Learn about the stock market, how to manage a portfolio, various methods of making a trade, etc.

# Technologies Used
1. Python and Flask
2. [IEX API](https://iexcloud.io/)
3. PostgreSQL, SQLAlchemy

# Learned About
1. REST API
2. Databases and ORM (Object-relational mapping)
3. HTTP Requests

# Challenges Faced
1. Deployment via Heroku (conversion from SQLite3 to PostgreSQL and SQLAlchemy)
2. Computation for user's portfolio before displaying (i.e. finding the sum for # of shares for unique symbols)
3. Disabled buttons to enable themselves when input form has been filled out (specific issue with number inputs)

# Current & Future Steps
Currently working on...
1. Implementing different order types

The next steps will be...
1. Adding more content to other pages with good UI (especially for stock quote page)
2. Add more functionality such as having a watchlist.
3. Content for educating beginners. Currently guiding users to links for useful resources to learn about terminology and concepts.
